				<h1>Breeding Birds in Europe</h1>
				<div class="row">
					<p>Every spring birds work hard to build their nests, perhaps in your garden like the robin or on your roofs like the Eurasian Oystercatcher has started to do in 
					Amsterdam. In the dunes, the forests or the tundras. All over Europe birds make their nests. On this page the dataset of the EBCC Atlas of the European Breeding Birds 
					(data from 1972-1995) has been visualised to show what the most common genera were per country species-wise. So whether more gull species breed in you country, or perhaps
			        finch species are in the majority. The visualisations show which countries score high on the number of breeding species and which made a lot of observations. If you are curious where a certain species breeds
					you can select that species in the dropdown menu.</p>

							<p>Two different views can be selected for the map: total number of species observed in a country or the total number of observations.
							Each observation is made in a specific coordinate within a country. It does not say how many breeding pairs of that species are within that coordinate, only that at least one was spotted.
							The species map shows that especially Russia has a high number of breeding bird species. Russia is the only country with more than 300 species. However the number of observations made in a country differs greatly which creates a bias towards countries with more observations. It ranges from 47 in Kazachstan to 29 468 observations in France. 
							Therefore these visualisations do not say much about the abundance of the species, only about the presence/absence of a species in a country, although it is nice to see that within a country some species are observed in more coordinates.</p>
							<p>In order to explore what type of birds can often be spotted breeding in a country, the top ten genera with the most species can be viewed by clicking a country. A genus is is formed by species that are closely related within a family (e.g. falcons). If a bar from a genus is clicked, the specific
							species are shown in a bargraph. More information about the genus or species can be obtained through the link to the wikipedia site that appears on hovering above a bar.</p>
							<p> By selecting a bird species in the dropdown menu below, the countries where a specific bird breeds are visualised. In the map it is clearly visible that some species
							only breed in the northern areas, like the Siberian Jay, whereas other species prefer the mediterranean climate. </p>
